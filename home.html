				<h2>What is Liminal Engineering?</h2>
				<p class="mx-auto text-wrap">Hello! I am Ben Choat. I use Liminal Engineering for all my 
					indepedent adventures into engineering, water resources, data science, and other fun 
					studies and projects. Liminal Engineering is engineering in the transitional spaces 
					between systems. Transitional spaces can refer to transitions through time and/or in space. 
					<br>
					<br>
					I am a Water Resources Scientist and Engineer in Training. I have expertise in 
					surface-subsurface interactions and anthropogenic alterations to the hydrologic cycle. 
					My interests range from precipitation formation in the atmosphere to subsurface flow - 
					to water at your tap - to the natural and societal systems that are affected by the 
					flow of water. 
					<br>
					<br>
					My experience includes finite element hydraulic modeling, finite difference surface-subsurface 
					modeling, statistical modeling, machine learning, systems analysis, stakeholder engagement,
					and more. My curiosity and desire to provide a benefit to society drive me to continuously 
					expand my skill set and experience. Iâ€™m highly skilled, capable, and eager to perform work 
					that shifts society towards sustainable management of its resources for the benefit of humans 
					and nature. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Ultimately, I believe by moving towards management of land, water, food, and energy within 
					the context of nature we can build healthy and happy societies and environments.

				<h2>What about this website?</h2>
				<p class="mx-auto text-wrap">I wanted to grow my web-app skills for fun and for
					professional development. So, I decided to learn Ploty, Plotly Dash, and Flask.
					Learning Flask led me to playing with HTML and CSS and dabbling in JavaScript 
					(Thank you CGPT!). 
					<br>
					<br>
					This website was created to serve two purposes:
					<br>
					1. Act as my personal website,
					<br>
					2. Provide a practical project to help me learn Flask, HTML, and CSS.
