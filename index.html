				<h2>What is Liminal Engineering?</h2>
				<div class="about-intro-row">
					<p class="mx-auto text-wrap">
						Liminal:
						<br>
						1. occupying a position at, or on both sides of, a boundary or threshold.
						<br>
						2. relating to a transitional or initial stage of a process.
						<br>
					</p>
						<hr style="width: 95%; margin: auto;">
					<p class="mx-auto text-wrap">
						Liminal Engineering is engineering in the transitional spaces 
						between systems - between natural and anthropogenic systems, across time and space.
						<br><br>
						Treating water as the connecting element, I apply data analytics and engineering principles
						to help manage water resources and hydrology for the benefit of nature and humans. 
						I seek synergies while mitigating risks to support resilient 
						communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems.
						<br><br>
						Ultimately, I believe by moving towards management of land, water, 
						food, and energy within the context of nature we can build healthy 
						and happy societies and environments.

				<p class="mx-auto text-wrap">
					My name is Ben Choat and I use Liminal Engineering for all my 
					independent adventures into engineering, water resources, data science, and other fun 
					studies and projects. 
					<br>
					<br>
					I am a Water Resources Scientist and Professional Engineer. I have expertise in 
					surface-subsurface interactions and anthropogenic alterations to the hydrologic cycle. 
					My interests range from precipitation formation in the atmosphere to subsurface flow - 
					to water at your tap - to the natural and societal systems that are affected by the flow of water. 
					<br>
					<br>
					My experience includes finite element hydraulic modeling, finite difference surface-subsurface 
					modeling, statistical modeling, machine learning, systems analysis, stakeholder engagement, 
					and more. I've also performed extensive field and lab work assisting with ecological and 
					agricultural research. My curiosity and desire to provide a benefit to society drive me to 
					continuously expand my skill set and experience. I'm highly skilled, capable, and eager to 
					perform work that shifts society towards sustainable management of its resources for the 
					benefit of humans and nature. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Ultimately, I believe by moving towards management of land, water, food, and energy within the 
					context of nature we can build healthy and happy societies and environments.

				<h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>
				<p class="mx-auto text-wrap">
					This website was created to serve two purposes:
					<br>
					<br>
					1. Act as my personal website,
					<br>
					2. Provide a practical project to help me learn Flask, HTML, and CSS.
					<br>
					<br>
					I wanted to grow my web-app skills for fun and for
					professional development. So, I decided to learn Ploty, Plotly Dash, and Flask.
					Learning Flask led me to playing with HTML and CSS and dabbling in JavaScript.
					I originally deployed this website on AWS for learning, but have since migrated to
					GitHub Pages. That required removing Flask, Dash, and any other Python code - using only
					JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
