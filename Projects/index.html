        <h2>Hydrologically Meaningful Regionalization including Anthropogenically Altered Catchments</h2>
        <H5 class="text-center">
          <!-- I presented this poster at HydroML 2024. It is a spin-off 
          of the last chapter of my dissertation which we are 
          still working on publishing. -->
          HydroML 2024 Abstract & Poster
        </H5> 
        <p class="mx-auto text-wrap">
          Previous efforts in hydrologic regionalization with unsupervised learning have focused on 
          separation of clustered catchments in variable space. Anthropogenic catchments are almost 
          always excluded from regionalization efforts and there is no effort to identify catchments 
          that do not fit in the regionalization scheme. To overcome these shortcomings, this ongoing 
          work is utilizing uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for reducing high 
          dimensional data capturing many natural and anthropogenic variables, primarily from the 
          GAGES-II dataset. Hierarchical density-based clustering in applications with noise (HDBSCAN) 
          is then being applied to cluster 3,200 catchments into regions. Ultimately, regression and 
          extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) are being used to predict monthly, annual, and mean-annual 
          water yield. The best hyperparameters associated with dimensions reduction, clustering, and 
          prediction are those that produce best predictions of water yield. This approach has shown 
          the ability to produce spatially contiguous regions despite no variables representing spatial 
          coordinates, and the ability to identify outlier catchments that do not fit in the identified 
          regionalization scheme. Next steps will investigate using supervised learning to predict which 
          region a catchment belongs to and exploration of feature importance to identify which variables 
          are needed to predict a catchmentâ€™s region and/or if a catchment is an outlier catchment. 
          Ideally, the number of variables needed for classification will be greatly reduced for practical 
          application to catchments for which such extensive data is not available.

        <h2>Agrohydrology</h2>
        <p class="mx-auto text-wrap">
          The current paradigm tends to view the balance of agricultural productivity
          and environmental stewardship as divergent concepts where pursuing one excludes the other.
          This perspective is from a unit-operations perspective that became popular due to rapid gains when implemented.
          However, enough time has passed that the negative aspects of a unit-operations approach have revealed themselves and 
          it is now clear that a systems-based approach is superior over medium to long timescales.

          I'm grateful to have contributed to a new paper, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022EF003410" target="_blank">
          Forming the Future of Agrohydrology.</a>
          The paper is based on one of the more fun conference sessions I've attended - Forming the Future of Agrohydrology 
          Research at the Frontiers in Hydrology Meeting (2022).
          <br><br> 
          In the paper we, as a  multidisciplinary  team, identify key research themes in agrohydrology, conceptualize future 
          research topics, and estimate timeframes before each topic becomes a limiting factor in advancing water management in 
          an agricultural context.
          <br><br>
          We envision a future where benefits far beyond food production are realized, externalities are minimized, and agriculture 
          is realized as a net benefit to the environment as well as to humans.

          conceptualization as a conference session to publication.</strong>

        <h2>Spatial Arangement of Stormwater Infiltration Study with ParFlow</h2>
          <p class="mx-auto text-wrap">
            As stormwater infiltration continues to be pursued to reduce overland flow generated in urban settings, it is necessary
            to understand the fate of the infiltrated water. Whether we choose to gather water into large or clustered areas and infiltrate it
            or distribute it to many small areas affects the fate of the infiltrated water.
            <br><br>
            My M.S. thesis at CSU focused on understanding how spatial arrangement of infiltrated water impacts the partitioning of subsurface storage
            between phreatic (saturated) and vadose (unsaturated) zones, <a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29HE.1943-5584.0002005" target="_blank">

          <h2>2D-Hydraulic Modeling of the Rossum Drive Reach of the Big Thompson Flood Recovery</h2>
            <p class="mx-auto text-wrap">
              In September of 2013 devastating flooding wrecked havoc in Colorado's northern front range. In 2016, I developed a 2D hydraulic model
              of a portion of the Big Thompson river that had been heavily impacted. Of note, a large pond had been filled with sediment and a local 
              pumpkin patch and golf course were flooded.
              <br><br>
              This modeling work explored three scenarios; 1. As-is streamflow response, 2. Adding a single auxillary channgel, and 3. Adding two auxillary channels.
              I did not have streamflow to calibrate to, so instead, used observations from an engineer with the City of Loveland. This way, we 
              were able to calibrate based on observed inundation at a known flows.
              Velocity and shear stress from the model were used by a colleague to design bank stabilization using the willow-post method.

            <h2>Valuation of Carbon Sequestration from NRCS Conservation Practices Using R-Shiny</h2>
              <p class="mx-auto text-wrap">
                As part of my NSF-Funded Food-Energy-Water fellowship, I participated in a project 
                with the Colorado Water Conservation Board to
                better understand the potential benefits related to carbon sequestration in the
                 instance of irrigated agriculture being
                converted to more natural vegetative cover in the Front Range of Colorado.

                The application is hosted on the free tier of Posit's Shiny Server. Because it is on the free
                tier, it runs a bit slow,
                and can take a moment to load. The app is also not optimized for mobile (or tiny screen) use, so 
                I do not suspect it will function as expeted if used on your phone.
